# üöÄ Recovery Machine - Go-Live Deployment Guide

> **Status:** Ready for deployment - No blocking bugs found
> **Last Updated:** January 2025
> **Pricing Updated:** ‚úÖ Site-wide (Memberships: $275/$525/$850, Household sessions: $175-$200)

---

## üìã Pre-Flight Checklist

- [x] Pricing updated site-wide
- [x] Bolt pricing constants updated
- [x] Supabase configured
- [x] Build passing (0 errors)
- [ ] **Bolt webhook configured**
- [ ] **Vercel environment variables set**
- [ ] **End-to-end booking tested**
- [ ] **Email confirmations verified**

---

## üîß Step 1: Configure Bolt Webhook (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
Without the webhook, payment confirmations won't update booking status or send confirmation emails. The webhook handler is already coded and ready‚Äîit just needs to be registered in Bolt's dashboard.

### Instructions

1. **Log into Bolt Merchant Dashboard**
   - URL: https://merchant.bolt.com
   - Use your merchant credentials

2. **Navigate to Webhooks**
   - Go to: **Developers** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
   - Click **"Create Webhook"** or **"Add Webhook"**

3. **Configure Webhook Settings**

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | **Webhook URL** | `https://therecoverymachine.co/api/webhooks/bolt` |
   | **Signing Secret** | `6ea6ff27806e0e519942e2b8f8f36562c585bb25c5f4c3c429146f411bdb1bb9` |
   | **Environment** | Start with `Sandbox`, switch to `Production` when ready |

4. **Select Events to Monitor**

   Enable these 3 events:
   - ‚úÖ `checkout.completed` - Triggers booking confirmation
   - ‚úÖ `checkout.failed` - Handles payment failures
   - ‚úÖ `refund.created` - Processes refunds

5. **Save and Test**
   - Click **"Create"** or **"Save Webhook"**
   - Bolt will send a test event to verify the endpoint
   - You should see a `200 OK` response

### Verification
- Check Bolt dashboard shows "Active" status next to webhook
- Note: The webhook handler code is at `app/api/webhooks/bolt/route.ts`

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 2: Set Vercel Environment Variables (CRITICAL)

### Why This Matters
Your local `.env` and `.env.local` files work in development, but Vercel needs these variables set in its dashboard for production deployment.

### Instructions

1. **Open Vercel Dashboard**
   - URL: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to your project: **Recovery Machine** (or whatever it's named)

2. **Go to Environment Variables**
   - Click **Settings** tab
   - Click **Environment Variables** in left sidebar

3. **Add Each Variable Below**

   For each variable, click **"Add New"**, then:
   - Enter the **Key** (variable name)
   - Enter the **Value** (copy from your local files)
   - Select environments: ‚úÖ Production, ‚úÖ Preview, ‚úÖ Development
   - Click **"Save"**

### Variables to Add

#### Production URLs
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://therecoverymachine.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://therecoverymachine.co

BOLT_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep `BOLT_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` initially. Switch to `production` only when ready for real payments.

#### Supabase Database
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://cgtazlhcyhghjlawkirf.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImNndGF6bGhjeWhnaGpsYXdraXJmIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTgyNDM2ODIsImV4cCI6MjA3MzgxOTY4Mn0.Oz76PvRpNTTrJMCOKbwWXTIzBePOqbLKLrCVk-qlwac

## üß™ Step 3: Test Booking Flow (End-to-End)

### Why This Matters
Verifies the entire payment ‚Üí booking ‚Üí email confirmation pipeline works in production.

### Test Scenario: Book a Cold Plunge Session

1. **Visit Production Site**
   - URL: https://therecoverymachine.co/booking
   - Or click "Book Now" button on homepage

2. **Select Service**
   - Choose: **"Cold Plunge Session"**
   - Verify price shows: **$175.00**
   - Duration shows: **60 minutes**

3. **Fill Booking Form**
   - **Name:** Your real name
   - **Email:** Use a real email you can check
   - **Phone:** Real phone number
   - **Date:** Tomorrow's date
   - **Time:** Any available slot
   - **Address:** Test address in Orange County
   - **Number of people:** 2

4. **Review Booking Summary**
   - Base price: $175.00
   - Travel fee: $0 (if within 5 miles) or $25 (if 5-15 miles out)
   - Total: Should calculate correctly

5. **Complete Bolt Payment**

   Use Bolt's test card for sandbox:
   ```
   Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
   Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
   CVV: 123
   ZIP: 90210
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Only use test cards when `BOLT_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox`

6. **Verify Redirect**
   - After payment, you should redirect to success page
   - Look for confirmation message

### What to Check After Test Booking

#### In Supabase Dashboard

1. **Check Orders Table**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí `orders`
   - Find your test order
   - Verify:
     - ‚úÖ `status` = `"paid"`
     - ‚úÖ `bolt_checkout_id` is populated
     - ‚úÖ `metadata.transaction_id` exists
     - ‚úÖ `metadata.paid_at` has timestamp

2. **Check Bookings Table**
   - Table Editor ‚Üí `bookings`
   - Find your test booking
   - Verify:
     - ‚úÖ `status` = `"confirmed"`
     - ‚úÖ `service_type` = `"cold_plunge"`
     - ‚úÖ `total_amount` = correct total (17500 + travel fees)

#### In Your Email Inbox

3. **Check Confirmation Email**
   - Look for email from Recovery Machine
   - Subject should contain: "Booking Confirmation"
   - Email should include:

     - ‚úÖ Date and time
     - ‚úÖ Location address
     - ‚úÖ Total price paid
     - ‚úÖ Contact information

#### In Vercel Logs (Optional - Advanced)

   - Look for recent POST request
   - Should show `200` status code
   - Check logs for: `"checkout.completed"` event processed

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Payment fails | Verify Bolt environment variables in Vercel |
| Booking status stays "pending" | Check webhook is configured in Bolt dashboard |
| No confirmation email | Check Resend API key and email logs in Vercel |
| Wrong price displayed | Clear browser cache, verify pricing constants updated |

---

## üìß Step 4: Verify Email System

### Test Email Delivery

2. **Verify Delivery Status**
   - Look for email to your test address
   - Status should be: **"Delivered"**
   - If "Bounced" or "Failed", check email address validity

### Email Code Location
- Template: `lib/services/email.ts`
- Sent from: `app/api/webhooks/bolt/route.ts` (line 145)
- Trigger: After `checkout.completed` webhook received

---

## üîÑ Step 5: Switch to Production Payments (When Ready)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY DO THIS WHEN READY FOR REAL MONEY

Currently, you're in **sandbox mode** - all payments are test transactions. When you're ready to accept real payments:

### Instructions

   - Log into Bolt Merchant Dashboard
   - Navigate to: **Developers** ‚Üí **API Keys**
   - Switch to **"Production"** environment

2. **Update Vercel Environment Variables**

   Replace these with production values:
   ```bash
   BOLT_API_KEY=<production-api-key>
   BOLT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<production-publishable-key>
   BOLT_MERCHANT_ID=<production-merchant-id>
   BOLT_DIVISION_PUBLIC_ID=<production-division-id>
   BOLT_ENVIRONMENT=production  # ‚Üê Change this from "sandbox"
   ```

3. **Register Production Webhook**
   - In Bolt Dashboard, switch to **Production** environment
   - Create new webhook (same URL as sandbox):
     - URL: `https://therecoverymachine.co/api/webhooks/bolt`
     - Generate NEW signing secret for production
   - Update Vercel variable:
     ```bash
     BOLT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<new-production-secret>
     ```

4. **Redeploy Application**

   - Use a real credit card
   - Verify funds are actually charged
   - **Immediately refund test transaction** using Bolt dashboard

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Production Bolt API keys set
- [ ] Production webhook registered with NEW secret
