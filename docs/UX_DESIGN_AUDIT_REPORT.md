## 1. User Experience Analysis

### 1.1 User Journey Mapping

#### Primary User Flow: Service Booking
```
Landing Page → Service Selection → Address Entry → Calendar Booking → Payment → Confirmation
```

**Journey Assessment:**
- **Entry Point (Hero)**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strong value proposition, clear CTAs
- **Service Selection**: ⭐⭐⭐ Simple but could benefit from comparison table
- **Address Entry**: ⭐⭐ Complex setup fee calculation may confuse users
- **Calendar Booking**: ⭐⭐⭐ Professional interface, good mobile adaptation
- **Payment**: ⭐⭐ Requires guest email collection, potentially friction-inducing
- **Confirmation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Clear confirmation with next steps

### 1.2 Conversion Funnel Analysis

**Critical Drop-off Points Identified:**

1. **Address Entry Step** - Setup fee calculation complexity
   - **Issue**: Users may abandon when seeing variable setup fees ($250-$500)
   - **Recommendation**: Show estimated total upfront, add fee calculator preview

2. **Payment Step Guest Flow** - Email requirement friction
   - **Issue**: Guest users forced to provide email before payment
   - **Recommendation**: Allow payment first, then account creation post-purchase

3. **Mobile Navigation** - Hidden booking CTA
   - **Issue**: Primary "Book Session" CTA requires menu expansion on mobile
   - **Recommendation**: Add persistent floating booking button

### 1.3 Information Architecture

**Navigation Structure Assessment:**
```
✅ GOOD: Simplified navigation (Home, Book, About, Dashboard)
⚠️  CONCERN: Mobile navigation hides booking action
❌ MISSING: Breadcrumbs for booking process
❌ MISSING: Progress persistence across browser sessions
```
