## üß™ DEVELOPER TESTING & QA

### **Payment Bypass for Testing** 
For developers and QA teams to test booking flows without processing real payments:

**How It Works:**
- **Development Only**: Payment bypass ONLY works in development environment (`localhost`)
- **Promo Code System**: Use special developer codes during checkout
- **Security Protected**: Cannot be used in production (multiple security layers prevent this)

**Available Test Codes:**
- `DEV100` - 100% discount (completely free booking)
- `DEVTEST` - 100% discount (alternative dev testing code)  
- `SKIPBOLT` - 100% discount (bypass Bolt payment processing)

**Usage Instructions:**
1. **Set Environment**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true` in `.env.local`
2. **Start Development**: Run `npm run dev` (localhost only)
3. **Go Through Booking**: Complete normal booking flow
4. **At Payment Step**: Enter any of the dev codes above
5. **Automatic Processing**: System bypasses payment and creates booking as "confirmed"

**What Happens:**
- ‚úÖ Real booking created in database
- ‚úÖ All email/SMS notifications sent  
- ‚úÖ Admin panel shows booking normally
- ‚úÖ Order record created (marked as dev bypass)
- ‚úÖ No real payment processed
- ‚úÖ All logging includes "üîß DEV MODE" prefix

**Security Features:**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Production Blocked**: Returns 403 error if attempted in production
- üõ°Ô∏è **Environment Validation**: Multiple checks for development environment
- üõ°Ô∏è **Clear Logging**: All dev orders clearly marked in admin panel
- üõ°Ô∏è **Audit Trail**: Dev bypass transactions tracked separately

**Perfect for:**
- Testing booking flows end-to-end
- QA validation without payment processing
- Demo scenarios for stakeholders
- Integration testing with real data
